# app.py - LEGACY FILE
# 
# THIS FILE HAS BEEN REFACTORED INTO MULTIPLE MODULES FOR BETTER MAINTAINABILITY
# 
# Please use main.py to run the application instead.
# The functionality has been split into the following modules:
# - config/settings.py: Configuration and constants
# - models/schemas.py: Pydantic models
# - database/operations.py: Database operations
# - services/: Authentication, ML models, conversation, chatbot
# - routes/: API endpoints organized by functionality
# - utils/: Common utilities
#
# To run the application, use: python main.py
#
# This file is kept for reference but should not be used directly.
